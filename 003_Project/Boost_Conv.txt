Boost converter;

Thanks to the coil, the energy cycle is provided.

It increases the input voltage at the output.

The diode is closed when the switching element is open.

VL=Vi with switch on

VL=Vi-Vo when key is cut

The circuit is based on the TPS61040DB datasheet.
Input and output capacitors (C1 and C3) are more advantageous when Nichicon brand is chosen, as they are not ordinary like Chinese made and have a long life.
Since R1 and R2 resistors are in Feedback, their tolerances should be low.
