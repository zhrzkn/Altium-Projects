Schematic designs of MCP2551T-I/SN and TJA1051 components, which are frequently used in CAN BUS communication, have been made.


MCP2551;
while the shape of the waves is the same, the voltages used to transmit the signal are different. The MCP2551 is a high-speed CAN transceiver.
It uses a differential signal whose recessive state is 0 V and dominant state is 2 V. Single-wire CAN is a one-wire signal whose recessive state is 0 V and dominant state is 4 V.
It is not a robust solution for a tool to be used across multiple applications.
